# What is Stock price?
A stock price is a given for every share issued by a publicly traded company. The price is a reflection of the company's value â€“ what the public is willing to pay for a piece of the company. It can and will rise and fall, based on a variety of factors in the global landscape and within the company itself.

# About the Project
This Project is able to track the stock price and plot the Closing price of the stock. We need to provide the sector for which we want to analyse the stock prices and after that we will be providing the number of companies for which we will be seeing the plot and then if we click the generate plot then the plot will be shown for the closing price of the stock for those companies.

# How to run the program?
run the command "python app.py" and select the parameters for which you want to see the plot.
